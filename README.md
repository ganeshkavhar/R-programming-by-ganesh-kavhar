Basic R Programming
R is a very flexible and powerful programming language, as well as a package that is written using that language (and others like C). The following program demonstrates many of its basic features. You can cut and paste it into R, or download the file that includes it from here. If you run it line by line, many of its features will become clear. Both editions of R for SAS and SPSS Users and R for Stata Users work through a version of this program line-by-line, showing the output and explaining what R is doing.
